# Template Goal Repository

A template to use when creating goal repositories.

Goal repositories should include (at minimum):

- A proper [LICENSE](LICENSE)
- A basic [README.md](README.md) file with some introductory information (doesn't need to be much)

To learn more about how to author goals, read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the [web-development-js](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js) repository.
